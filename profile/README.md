# 🧠 MIND Data Standard  
**Multimodal Interoperable N-Dimensional Dynamics**  
> **A shared foundation for studying, modelling, and building minds.**

## Overview

The **MIND Data Standard** is an open framework for describing, utilizing, and exchanging research data across the sciences of mind and intelligence. It provides a shared language that connects experimental, computational, and interactive approaches — supporting both real-time and offline use.

#### MIND draws inspiration from open initiatives that have reshaped scientific and technical collaboration.

> Standards like the **Brain Imaging Data Structure ([BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/))** and **Neurodata Without Borders ([NWB](https://www.nwb.org/))** have made it possible for researchers to share and compare data with unprecedented transparency, while **Lab Streaming Layer ([LSL](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer))** and the **OpenXR standard ([OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/))** demonstrate the power of interoperability in breaking down technical barriers in real time. MIND brings these worlds together — combining reproducible data practices and real-time systems — within a framework built to evolve alongside emerging AI standards, exemplified by initiatives like [**neuro-galaxy**](https://github.com/neuro-galaxy).

By linking structured data, real-time interaction, and emerging AI frameworks, MIND creates a foundation for research that is both reproducible and adaptive — connecting human and artificial intelligence within a shared ecosystem.

## Motivation

#### Human and artificial intelligence are increasingly interconnected.  

Advances in each domain now inform and accelerate the other, yet the systems and standards that support them remain largely siloed.  
Neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence, and human–computer interaction all seek to understand the same fundamental processes — perception, learning, and behaviour — but they do so through distinct data languages and incompatible tools.

#### MIND seeks to bridge this divide.  

It provides a common representational framework where behavioural, physiological, and computational data can coexist — allowing insights, models, and methodologies to flow freely across disciplines. By creating shared structure for how we describe and exchange the dynamics of minds, MIND supports collaboration across fields that have historically evolved in isolation, helping to align the study of intelligence with the systems that model it.

## What MIND Enables

- **Unified multimodal data** describing movement, interaction, and neural activity across devices and modalities.  
- **Standardised real-time streaming**, enabling synchronised recording and live experimentation.  
- **Common model interfaces**, allowing AI systems to produce and consume data in the same structured format used by human experiments.  
- **Training and evaluation pipelines** for foundational models of perception, action, and cognition — grounded in rich, standardised human data.  

MIND connects data collection, analysis, and simulation in one interoperable framework — built for both reproducible science and real-time innovation.

## A Collaborative Vision

The **MIND Data Standard** organisation coordinates the development of the MIND ecosystem — a family of open-source repositories, tools, and specifications dedicated to interoperable behavioural and cognitive data.

Its goal is to cultivate a **shared foundation for the sciences of mind**:  
linking behavioural researchers, neuroscientists, and AI developers through a common technical language.

## Repositories

| Repository | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **MIND-Standard** | Core specification and JSON Schema definitions. |
| **MIND-Sharp** | Reference .NET SDK for validation, serialisation, and streaming. |
| **MIND-Python** *(planned)* | Cross-platform Python SDK for data validation, analysis, and integration with AI workflows. |
| **MIND-Unity** | Unity integration toolkit for real-time experimentation and visualisation. |

Together, these repositories form the technical foundation of the MIND ecosystem — supporting open, reproducible, and real-time research across disciplines.
