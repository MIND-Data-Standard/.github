## Overview

The MIND Data Standard is an open ecosystem that includes specification documents, schema definitions, and software development kits (SDKs).  
To balance openness, interoperability, and flexibility of use, different components of the ecosystem are released under different open-source licenses.

This document describes how licensing is structured across MIND repositories and how these licenses interact.

## 1. Specification and Schemas

**Repository:** [`MIND-Standard`](https://github.com/MIND-Data-Standard/MIND-Standard)  
**License:** [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

The MIND specification, associated JSON Schemas, and related documentation are distributed under the **CC BY 4.0** license.

This allows unrestricted use, redistribution, and modification — including for commercial or derivative works — provided that appropriate credit is given to the *MIND Data Standard Organisation*.

This license type is widely adopted for open standards documentation, including **BIDS**, **NWB**, **OpenMINDS**, and **OpenXR**.

## 2. SDKs and Software Libraries

**Repositories:**
- [`MIND-Sharp`](https://github.com/MIND-Data-Standard/MIND-Sharp)
- [`MIND-Python`](https://github.com/MIND-Data-Standard/MIND-Python)
- [`MIND-Unity`](https://github.com/MIND-Data-Standard/MIND-Unity)

**License:** [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

All MIND SDKs and software components are released under the permissive **MIT License**, allowing free use, modification, and redistribution with minimal restrictions.

This ensures compatibility with:
- Scientific computing environments (Python, MATLAB, etc.)
- Game engines and XR frameworks (Unity, Unreal)
- Academic and commercial applications

---

## 3. Integration and Example Repositories

Some repositories (e.g., **LABO integrations**, data examples, or experimental toolkits) may combine specification and software materials.

- Documentation and schemas follow **CC BY 4.0**
- Code and tooling follow **MIT**

Where mixed content exists, each directory includes its own `LICENSE` file for clarity.

---

## 4. Attribution Guidelines

When reusing or extending MIND materials, please include:

> **Based on the MIND Data Standard © 2025 MIND Data Standard Organisation**  
> *Licensed under CC BY 4.0 / MIT (as applicable)*  
> [https://github.com/MIND-Data-Standard](https://github.com/MIND-Data-Standard)

This helps maintain transparency and traceability while supporting derivative work across academia and industry.

---

## 5. Trademarks and Naming

“MIND Data Standard” and the acronym “MIND” refer to the open standard and its organisational body.  
Use of these names in derivative works is encouraged for attribution but may not be used to imply official endorsement or certification without prior written approval.
